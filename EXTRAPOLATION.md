# Extrapolation For Production

## Executive Summary

The production cutover is now in a strong place.

This repo no longer has the same "pretend production" shape it had earlier in the effort. The runtime and control-plane contract are materially cleaner now:

- one inference execution path
- one network/connectivity model
- one source of truth for peer identity and reachability
- one ring topology story
- fewer silent fallbacks and fewer fake future modes

The main value of continuing from here is mostly net-new capability work, not more compatibility cleanup in the current runtime path.

## Production Status

### Completed Productionization

- ✅ Durable inference dispatch replaced poll-only queue semantics with explicit submit, claim, acknowledge, result, and status flows.
- ✅ Network creation and registration now use typed connectivity configuration instead of loose relay-address plumbing.
- ✅ Device heartbeat/runtime state reports actual connectivity status, active path, peer identity, and advertised listen addresses back to the control plane.
- ✅ Ring topology returns authoritative worker metadata, including peer IDs, connectivity state, and listen addresses.
- ✅ Agents persist and consume real neighbor peer IDs and neighbor listen addresses instead of placeholder local values.
- ✅ Mesh startup, ring inference, and ad hoc mesh jobs now respect configured connectivity mode instead of assuming relay-only startup.
- ✅ Direct mode is a real supported startup path.
- ✅ Unsupported overlay mode was removed instead of left around as a fake production option.
- ✅ Dead compatibility code such as the scheduler shim was removed rather than left deprecated in-path.
- ✅ Ring gossip verification is enforced.
- ✅ Beacon trust/verification work is materially stronger than before.
- ✅ Checkpointing and checkpoint recovery are integrated into the inference coordinator.
- ✅ Shard-loading hardening landed earlier in the same productionization effort.

### What This Means

The system now behaves much more like a real production runtime:

- dispatch state is durable and observable
- connectivity is explicit instead of implied
- peer identity and reachability come from authoritative runtime reports
- ring metadata is no longer filled with placeholder/local-only values
- unsupported runtime paths were removed instead of silently tolerated

### Determinism Note

The strict deterministic Fozzy doctor run was consistent across 5/5 runs for `tests/production_dispatch.fozzy.json` with the same signature each time.

## What Is No Longer Accurate To Say

The following are now stale and should not be described as still-missing core production blockers:

- durable job dispatch
- explicit worker-acknowledged state transitions
- typed connectivity configuration
- authoritative ring peer metadata
- runtime reporting of connectivity/listen addresses
- direct-vs-relayed startup selection in the active path
- removal of fake overlay support
- removal of the scheduler compatibility shim
- stronger ring gossip verification

## Remaining Work

### Not Must-Fix For This Cutover

These are the main remaining production-facing areas, but they are mostly new capability work rather than cleanup of the old path:

- ⬜ A dedicated higher-performance data plane beyond libp2p request/response for tensor movement.
- ⬜ Stronger NAT traversal, including explicit punched-path execution rather than only direct vs relayed selection.
- ⬜ More complete runtime governance and backpressure controls across transport, execution, and recovery paths.
- ⬜ Any future overlay backend must be implemented for real before reintroduction.

### Still Worth Hardening Over Time

- ⬜ Broader host-backed and multi-scenario Fozzy coverage for more runtime paths beyond `production_dispatch`.
- ⬜ More explicit operator-facing visibility into path quality, fallback reasons, and degraded connectivity behavior.
- ⬜ Continued work on production-grade model/data-plane performance once correctness is no longer the dominant concern.

## Recommended Next Phase

If work continues, the highest-value direction is not more compatibility cleanup. It is:

1. Build a real dedicated data plane for tensor traffic.
2. Improve NAT traversal and punched-path behavior.
3. Add stronger resource governance and backpressure.
4. Reintroduce overlay connectivity only if it is implemented as a real production backend.

## Bottom Line

The biggest win from this effort is that the runtime contract is now explicit, durable, and authoritative instead of aspirational.

The repo is in a much better production shape because it now has:

- a real dispatch lifecycle
- a real connectivity model
- a real source of truth for peer identity and reachability
- a real ring topology contract
- fewer fake modes and fewer silent fallbacks

That is the core value delivered here.
